      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a former math teacher of six years.  I love math as well as technology.  I was all about entering formulas into Excel to track student data.  Now I am looking forward to learning new tools to help me make this career change.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Bailey, CO.  I grew up playing outdoors with my brother and friends.  At the time, growing up an hour away from most 'teen activities' like a movie theater, mall, etc. was difficult.  Looking back, though, I wouldn't change my hometown location.  I am very grateful to have been raised in Bailey.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love watching Nuggets games, in-person preferrably, but on TV is also exciting.  I have a pug named Noodle, so playing with her is also fun.  I also like to scrapbook with my favorite memories of friends and vacations.  Of course this list wouldn't be compelete without listing that I love math; whether it's tutoring or a solving a simple algebraic equation.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I am still working on determining the fine details, but I know my love of math and tech will need to be applied.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently I live in Colorado.  I have traveled many places, but CO is my home-base.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have a creative side, but also technical.  I want to keep users engaged in the site they're using, but also help maintain the site's efficiency.</p>
